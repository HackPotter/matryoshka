# matryoshka
A python tool designed for nested archive CTF puzzles. Initial focus will be on popular archive/compression formats (tar, zip, 7z, etc.).
Currently does nothing, as I have not begun real development yet. When it finally does something, it'll probably do it badly, so I encourage you to avoid using this code if at all possible.
